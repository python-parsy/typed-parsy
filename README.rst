Typed Parsy
-----------

**NOTE:** This repo is an **experimental** attempt to create a **backwards
incompatible** version of parsy that has strong type guarantees, with no
``Any`` slipping in to spoil things.

This means removing anything that cannot be typed fully, and providing
alternatives. Main changes:

* Removed ``seq``, and replaced it with ``&`` operator support which returns a 2-tuple
* Removed ``alt`` - you can use only ``|`` operator.
* Removed ``.combine`` and ``.combine_dict`` - you have to use ``.map`` instead,
  which is type-safe but much trickier, especially once you have nested tuples.

The docs have not been updated, youâ€™ll need to look at the source code
if you are interested.

See `my blog post <https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/python-type-hints-parsy-case-study/>`_ 
for the background to this. The current status of this code is **abandoned**,
but I am open to someone else taking it on if they have serious plans.

----

Parsy is an easy and elegant way to parse text in Python by combining small
parsers into complex, larger parsers. If it means anything to you, it's a
monadic parser combinator library for LL(infinity) grammars in the spirit of
`Parsec <https://github.com/haskell/parsec>`_, `Parsnip
<http://parsnip-parser.sourceforge.net/>`_, and `Parsimmon
<https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon>`_. But don't worry, it has really good
documentation and it doesn't say things like that!

Parsy requires Python 3.6 or greater.

For a good example of the kind of clear, declarative code you can create using
parsy, see the `SQL SELECT statement example
<https://parsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/other_examples.html#sql-select-statement-parser>`_
or `JSON parser
<https://parsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/other_examples.html#json-parser>`_.
